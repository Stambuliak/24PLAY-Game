Welcome to my Creature Runner Game, a project I created while learning the Three.js library. In this game, you control a character and dodge obstacles as you run. I've implemented this game using React and Three.js, and I have plans for future improvements, including optimization, scoring, saving high scores, animations, and more.

## How to Play

- Use the left arrow key or 'd' to move left to avoid obstacles.
- Use the right arrow key or 'a' to move right.
- If you need to retry, simply click the "Try again" button.

## Local Setup

To play the game on your local server:

1. Clone the repository to your device using `git clone`.
2. Make any improvements or changes you'd like.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the game on your localhost.

Feel free to fork this project and contribute to its development. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Stay tuned for updates and more features coming soon!
